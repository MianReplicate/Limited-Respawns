# Limited Respawns
**....is a Minecraft mod that makes it so you can only respawn a certain amount of times until you run out.**

***This mod may be used in any modpack.***

**This mod only needs to be installed on the _SERVER!_**

**This description only applies to versions of the mod 3.0.0 & higher. Versions earlier are missing a lot of the advertised features.**

## ❓ FAQ
- What is the different between this and Limited Lives?
  - Limited Lives reduces your max hearts every time you die and it has different configuration options compared to this mod
- What's up with the random colored messages?
  - These colors are based off the GF & NB pride flag schemes. You can disable them if wanted in the configuration settings. (i felt queer 😛)
